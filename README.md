# Javascomp

**Javascomp** is a modern JavaScript compiler designed to offer a superior development experience with a focus on robust static typing and ease of learning for beginners.

Unlike traditional runtimes (like Node.js or Deno) or transpiled supersets (like TypeScript), Javascomp aims to be a **truly compiled language**, bringing performance and safety from the build stage.

## 🚀 Goals

- **True Compilation**: Transform JavaScript-style code into efficient binaries or optimized bytecode, without relying on a heavy interpreted runtime.
- **Strong & Static Typing**: A type system that helps prevent common errors before the code even runs, without excessive configuration complexity.
- **Beginner Friendly**: Clear, educational, and helpful error messages. The compiler "talks" to you to explain what went wrong and how to fix it.
- **Performance**: Written in Rust to ensure speed and memory safety during the compilation process.

## 🛠️ Current State

The project is in the early stages of development. The current structure includes a basic lexer implemented in Rust.

## 📦 Installation and Usage

*(Installation instructions will be added soon)*

To run the current development environment (requires Rust installed):

```bash
cargo run
```
